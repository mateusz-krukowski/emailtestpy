<b>python snippet for email sending</b>
<p>currently it only works with icloud because of google's strict security which i haven't been able to get around so far</p>
<p>in order to confugire access to apple's smtp go to https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage/section/security 
and create app-specific password to be used as your password for sending mails via smtp </p>
